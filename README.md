So, here is the recipes project, the first project in the Odin Project basics course.  It seems to cover the HTML knowledge that I have learned so far, by having me create a basic website and link to multiple recipes in the website.

After completing this project, I feel confident in the HTML basics that I have learned.  I built HTML boilerplates for my index.html file and each of my recipe files.  My Index HTML file included a href tags to link to my recipes, formatted in an ordered list on the main page of the website. The recipes included heading elements, images with alt tags, and unordered and ordered lists, which all came to life in the website itself.
