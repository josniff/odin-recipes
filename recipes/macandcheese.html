    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaoni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>

        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bread crumb topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven the 350 degrees farenheit. Grese an 8-inch baking dish</li>
        <li>To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk 2 Â½ cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</li>
        <li>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
